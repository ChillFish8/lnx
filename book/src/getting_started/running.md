# Running
Running a default version of lnx can be done simply using the following commands:

#### Running
```bash
lnx <flags>
```
This will start the sever in a default configuration.

*NOTE: It is generally recommend to customise the running on lnx for production and optimum systems,
see [**optimising lnx**](optimising.md) for information on why it matters for performance sake.* 

#### Help
```bash
lnx --help
``` 
This will bring up a detailed help command for 
all CLI options (including environment options.)

## Optional Flags
lnx provides a wide set of command line arguments to customise the running
of the server.
